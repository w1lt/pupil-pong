# PupilPong

Welcome to [PupilPong](http://pupilpong.tech/), the revolutionary new version of the classic arcade game Pong! Our company has developed a cutting-edge system that allows players to control the game using only their eyes.

Our technology uses advanced eye-tracking software to accurately capture a player's eye movements and translate them into real-time gameplay. This means that every move, every block, and every point is controlled entirely by the player's eyes.

## Installation


```bash
pip install -r requirements
brew install flac
brew install Pillow
brew install autoaudio
brew install pyaudio
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 pong_menu.py
```
