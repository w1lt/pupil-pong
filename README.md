# 🏓 Pupil Pong // HackKU 2023 🏓

Welcome to [Pupil Pong](http://pupilpong.tech/), the revolutionary new version of the classic arcade game Pong! Our company has developed a cutting-edge system that allows players to control the game using only their eyes.

Our technology uses advanced eye-tracking software to accurately capture a player's eye movements and translate them into real-time gameplay. This means that every move, every block, and every point is controlled entirely by the player's eyes.

## 👨‍💻 Installation


```bash
pip install -r requirements
brew install flac
brew install Pillow
brew install autoaudio
brew install pyaudio
```

## 🎮 Usage
To run the game, enter the following into the root directory:
```bash
python3 pong_menu.py
```
Then, speak which command you would like to run, and begin playing.

We all had a blast working on **Pupil Pong**. With all of us being freshman at KU, we thoroughly enjoyed our first hackathon ever. In addition to being all of our firsts hackathons, it was also our first time pulling an all nighter, which was admittedly part of the fun. We hope you all enjoy our project, thank your for checking it out.
