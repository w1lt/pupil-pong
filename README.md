# 🏓 Pupil Pong - HackKU 2023 🏓

Welcome to [Pupil Pong](http://pupilpong.tech/), the revolutionary new version of the classic arcade game Pong! Our company has developed a cutting-edge system that allows players to control the game using only their eyes.

Our technology uses advanced eye-tracking software to accurately capture a player's eye movements and translate them into real-time gameplay. This means that every move, every block, and every point is controlled entirely by the player's eyes.

## 🌐 About the Project
Within _Pupil Pong_, we utilize Eye Tracking to detect the movements of the pupil in relation to the eye. Using the horizontal and vertical ratios between the pupil and the edges of the eyeball👁️, our game can detect which direction the player wants to move their right paddle and move it in that direction without needing to physically interact with a device _at all_.

During the initial menu of our game, we utilize voice commands that allow the user to easily choose between three options: play game, which starts the game; about, which displays the creators and teaches the player how to play the game; and quit, which exits the program entirely.

Our game is made using _Python_ and is Object-Oriented. We implemented our pong like game using the _Python_ game engine _Pygame_. We learned how to combine multiple different libraries together to create a seamless experience. In addition, we got more comfortable using _Github_ for version control and collaboration, which made sharing our code much easier and quicker. Last but not least, we gained more experience using _pip_ and _homebrew_ to install new libraries on our computers





## 👨‍💻 Installation


```bash
pip install -r requirements
brew install flac
brew install Pillow
brew install autoaudio
brew install pyaudio
```

## 🎮 Usage
To run the game, enter the following into the root directory:

We all had a blast working on **Pupil Pong**. With all of us being freshman at KU, we thoroughly enjoyed our first hackathon ever.
